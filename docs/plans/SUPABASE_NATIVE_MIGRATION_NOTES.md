# Supabase/native migration — execution notes and checkpoint ledger

Created at C00 per `docs/plans/SUPABASE_NATIVE_MIGRATION_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` §9.
This file is updated after every checkpoint. It contains no record bodies, credentials, or sample personal data.

## Outcome (current)

`C00 complete at repository level` — the column matrix and durable-data classification below are derived from the applied migration SQL of both providers and the current source. Live-deployment inventory (catalog inspection, data volumes, recoverable backups, operational budgets) is **BLOCKED** on operator-provided environments and recorded, not guessed. No production migration has been attempted; production transfer additionally requires explicit C09 authorization. Checkpoints C01 onward have not started.

## Baseline

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Recorded at | 2026-09-19 (C00 execution) |
| Plan baseline revision | `a2cead0d3ed6e6d8fe9a67b2e70e119ffec3e5fc` |
| Working tree HEAD at C00 | `89d20effa8e2b8e5e0ebeca3e4ff7e1df3ae29a2` |
| Working tree status | clean at C00 start; after C00 only this notes file is added (`git status --short`: `?? docs/plans/SUPABASE_NATIVE_MIGRATION_NOTES.md`) |
| Application version | 1.0.3 (`package.json`) |
| Backends | `native` (self-hosted PostgreSQL, scrypt auth) and `supabase` (PostgREST + Supabase Auth), selected by `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND` |

## Checkpoint ledger

| Checkpoint | Status | Evidence / notes |
|---|---|---|
| C00 | COMPLETE (repository-level inputs) | Column matrix and classification below, derived from `db/migrations/0001..0031` (no `0027` exists) and `supabase/migrations/20260810150000..20260929000000`. V0 and V1 verification recorded below. **BLOCKED items** (require deployment operator inputs): live catalog inspection against both datasets, row volumes, normalized-email/UUID collision scan, reference-name conflicts, singleton settings state, orphan references, legacy `role` inconsistencies, NOT-VALID-constraint violations, deleted-actor references, precision/hierarchy shape, recoverable backup inventory (data + Auth + objects), numeric downtime/recovery budgets, bundle retention, observation window, access windows, external-object scope, pending mobile writes, SMTP/enrollment readiness, first production direction, reserved recovery destination. These are recorded as unanswered inputs per the plan's stop rules; none were guessed. |
| C01 | PASS (repository + disposable-database legs) | Bundle format/validator, explicit connectors, read-only sessions, run journal and the `validate`/`inspect`/`preflight` CLI. V2: 53 tests pass (`tests/migration-format.test.ts`, `tests/migration-cli.test.ts`). V3: typecheck, lint, boundary tests (12) and coverage gate pass. Live: read-only `inspect` against the local Supabase stack and a disposable native database (write probes rejected); live `preflight` validated a fixture bundle, rejected same-instance aliasing and blocked (exit 5) on unverifiable Auth binding. See the C01 section below. |
| C01M | NOT STARTED | Depends on C01 (now satisfied). |
| C02 | NOT STARTED | Requires disposable native + Supabase instances (V4). |
| C03 | NOT STARTED | Depends C02, C06A. |
| C04 | NOT STARTED | Depends C02. |
| C05 | NOT STARTED | Depends C03, C04, C06A. |
| C06A | NOT STARTED | Design gate after C01M; needs the BLOCKED C00 operational inputs. |
| C06B | NOT STARTED | |
| C07 | NOT STARTED | |
| C08 | NOT STARTED | |
| C09 | NOT STARTED | Explicit production authorization required; not requested. |
| C10 | NOT STARTED | |

## Confirmed requirements (restated from the plan; not re-asked)

- Planned switching with both writers fenced during final planning/apply; measured downtime budget still to be recorded (BLOCKED C00 item).
- Populated destinations supported and protected; empty destinations also supported.
- Incoming passwords are not transferred; existing destination credentials keep working; new accounts enroll on the destination.
- Both deployments run the same application release; each provider's schema fingerprint is verified independently.
- Unified identity behavior through the existing auth facade/identity contracts; no new identity service.
- Keep existing destination IDs where safe; otherwise allocate and persist complete mappings.

## Durable-data classification (C00 deliverable 3)

Derived from the migration SQL of both providers. **Live catalog confirmation is a BLOCKED C00 item** — source files alone do not establish deployed state.

### Business data (in the future migration bundle)

| Table | Columns (canonical order) | Constraints a merge must re-validate | Provider differences |
|---|---|---|---|
| `profiles` | id (uuid pk), email (uniq), name, department, title, permission_role (admin/pm/co/user), hierarchy_role (manager/team_lead/engineer/user), is_active, manager_id (self-fk, set null), dashboard_layout (jsonb), admin_layout (jsonb), mobile_layout (jsonb), created_at | role CHECKs (`N 0009:21-27`, `S 20260826000000`); legacy `role` re-derived by trigger `sync_legacy_role` (`N 0009:30-46`, `S 20260826000000:26-42`) — legacy column must never be imported, it is recomputed on the destination | **N-only (exclude from bundle):** `password_hash` (`N 0001:27`), `session_version` (`N 0023:4-11`). **S-only (exclude):** `mobile_password_change_started_at` (`S 20260924000000:5`). S `profiles.id` references `auth.users(id) on delete cascade` (`S 20260810160000:29`) — destination identity must exist before profile state; the `on_auth_user_created` trigger enforces the domain whitelist and auto-activate (`S 20260825000000:30-64`) |
| `projects` | id, name (uniq), so_number, telegram_no (unique partial where not null), created_at | unique name; unique telegram_no (`N 0003:13-19`, `S 20260816000000:13-19`) | none |
| `activity_types` | id, name (uniq), is_active, telegram_no (unique partial), created_at | as above (`N 0002`, `S 20260815000000`) | none |
| `timesheets` | id, user_id fk, project_id fk (restrict), activity_type_id fk nullable (set null), log_date (date), hours_worked numeric(4,2), work_done, created_at | CHECK `hours_worked > 0 AND <= 24` (`N 0015:7-9`, `S 20260831000000:7-9`); daily-cap trigger `check_daily_hours_limit` with advisory lock (`N 0011/0015`, `S 20260823000000/20260831000000`); `(user_id, log_date)` uniqueness was dropped — multiple entries/day (`N 0005:8`, `S 20260818000000:8`) | `work_done` unbounded at DB level; the S restore RPC truncates it to 2000 chars (`S 20260914000000:86-88`) — migration export must not imitate that |
| `leaves` | id, user_id fk, leave_date, reason, created_at | UNIQUE `(user_id, leave_date)`; CHECK `char_length(reason) <= 500` NOT VALID (`N 0017:13-16`, `S 20260905010000:18-21`) — pre-existing violations possible on either side | none |
| `reminders` | id, user_id fk, message, remind_at, done, created_at | CHECK `char_length(message) <= 500` NOT VALID (`N 0017:18-21`, `S 20260905010000:23-26`) | none |
| `global_reminders` | id, message, remind_at, created_at | none | none |
| `global_reminder_dismissals` | user_id fk, reminder_id fk (composite pk), dismissed_at | none | none |
| `app_settings` | id=1 singleton, backfill_window_days, backfill_mode (days/month_start), backfill_extra_days, default_dashboard_layout, default_admin_layout, default_mobile_layout, app_name, primary_color, logo_url, updated_at | singleton CHECK id=1; mode CHECK (`N 0001/0002/0010/0019/0020`, `S 20260813000000/20260815000000/20260827000000/20260907000000/20260908000000`) | none |
| `titles` | id (**N: text** `gen_random_uuid()::text` / **S: uuid**), name (uniq), hierarchy_role, created_at | unique name; hierarchy_role CHECK (`N 0014/0021/0022`, `S 20260830000000/20260909000000`) | **PK type differs** — a cross-provider copy is a declared transformation, not a value copy. N-only functional unique index on `lower(name)` (`N 0022:4`) has no S equivalent |
| `whitelisted_domains` | id (**N: text / S: uuid**), domain (uniq), auto_activate, created_at | unique domain | same PK-type difference |
| `audit_logs` | id, actor_id fk nullable (set null), actor_email, action, target_id, detail (jsonb), created_at | none | S insert policy binds `actor_id = auth.uid()` (`S 20260824000000:20-42`) — historical import goes through service role; append-only semantics preserved |

### Internal / operational (excluded from bundle; disposition per category)

| Table | Providers | Disposition |
|---|---|---|
| `mobile_sessions` | both (`N 0017:4-25`, `S 20260904000000`) | Excluded — session safety is C06A/C06B scope; the S table is service-role-only with a password-change insert guard trigger |
| `password_reset_tokens` | N only (`N 0023:13-27`) | Excluded — destination recovery behavior is authoritative |
| `rate_limits` | both (`N 0024:16-33`, `S 20260911000000`) | Excluded (operational state); S access is service-role-only via SECURITY DEFINER RPCs |
| `idempotency_keys` | both (`N 0026:4-15`, `S 20260913010000`) | Operational state — **do not bulk-copy**; semantic mapping is a C06A contract decision |
| `idempotency_effects` | S only (`S 20260920000000:51-85`); N `0031` is an explicit no-op | Provider-specific effect evidence — not interchangeable; C06A decides |
| Migration ledgers | `public.schema_migrations` (created by `db/migrate-runner.mjs:55-62`, not by migration SQL), `supabase_migrations.schema_migrations` | Provider infrastructure — never copied |

### Provider-owned (never copied)

`auth` (Supabase Auth; FK target of `profiles.id`, `auth.uid()` in ~40 policies/functions), `supabase_migrations`, and the app-created `private` schema holding SECURITY DEFINER idempotency trigger helpers (`S 20260920000000:92-95`). `storage`/`realtime`/`extensions`/`vault`/`pgsodium` are unreferenced in both migration trees. External objects (logo files etc.) are deployment-specific; their inventory is a BLOCKED C00 item.

### Provider deltas that shape the later design

1. `profiles.id` = `auth.users.id` on Supabase: native→supabase identity provisioning must create Auth users with preserved or explicitly mapped UUIDs before profile/business rows; supabase→native is a plain copy minus credential columns.
2. `titles.id`/`whitelisted_domains.id` text (N) vs uuid (S): requires a declared transformation.
3. No sequences or generated columns exist anywhere; UUID defaults only — no sequence reconciliation is needed.
4. NOT VALID CHECKs (`leaves`, `reminders`) can hide pre-existing violations — the live scan (BLOCKED) must check them before any merge claim.
5. The Supabase SECURITY DEFINER surface (report/restore/idempotency/session RPCs) is recreated by provider migrations, never copied.

## Data inventory (C00 deliverable 4) — BLOCKED

Requires read-only access to both live datasets: row volumes per table, normalized-email collisions, UUID collisions, reference-name conflicts, singleton settings state, orphan references, legacy `role` inconsistencies, NOT-VALID-constraint violations, deleted-actor references, timestamp precision and hierarchy shape. **Not executed in this environment.** No silent cleanup or account linking will be inferred; findings will be recorded here once an operator provides disposable or authorized read-only access.

## Operational inputs (C00 deliverables 5–6) — BLOCKED (operator-supplied)

- Numeric downtime and recovery budgets; bundle retention period; observation window; access windows.
- External-object scope (logo/files), pending mobile writes, SMTP/enrollment readiness, first production direction.
- Recovery destination reservation for the entire merged authority after target writes (including provisioning/reenrollment cost).
- Recoverable backup inventory for source and destination (data + Auth + objects) and the named conflict reviewers.
- Destination-owned rows/identities/configuration that must survive; schema-only bootstrap policy for empty-target tests; same-application-release verification across both deployments.

## Verification evidence (C00)

| Command | Result |
|---|---|
| V0: `rtk proxy git rev-parse HEAD` / `git status --short` / `git diff --stat` / `git diff --check` | HEAD `89d20effa8e2b8e5e0ebeca3e4ff7e1df3ae29a2`; tree clean at start; no whitespace problems; after C00 the only change is this notes file (untracked) |
| V1: `rtk proxy npm test -- tests/backup.test.ts tests/operations-domain.test.ts tests/supabase-restore.test.ts tests/backup-restore-route.test.ts` | **4 files, 38/38 tests passed** — matches the architecture assessment's 38 passes at the recorded revision; no existing failure to attribute |
| Schema inventory | Static read of both `migrations/` trees (matrix above); live catalog inspection BLOCKED |

## Deviations from the plan

None. All C00 deliverables were either completed from repository evidence or recorded as BLOCKED with their required inputs named; no policy was guessed and no deployment was touched.

## Delegation and file ownership

Implementation work is committed per checkpoint; each checkpoint updates this ledger in the same commit. The plan's checkpoint order is respected; C01M (planning semantics) is implemented before any database slice.

## Implementation at checkpoint C01

**Deliverables (all committed on `arch/dual-backend-modular-implementation`):**

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `lib/migration/format.ts` | Bundle format v1, canonical value contract, entity/column allowlist (12 entities), dependency order, provenance/plan/resolution base schemas, digests. |
| `lib/migration/validation.ts` | Offline bundle validation: symlinks, unknown files, size/row bounds, digests, canonical bytes, primary-key uniqueness, dependency order, provenance. |
| `lib/migration/schema.ts` | Pure catalog model, schema fingerprint, canonical-kind vs live-UDT compatibility. |
| `lib/migration/connections.ts` | Explicit `MIGRATION_*` env resolution, provider allowlist, project-ref extraction, Auth/database binding rules. |
| `lib/migration/journal.ts` | Exclusive run directory/artifacts, append-only JSONL journal, run lock, secret-shaped redaction. |
| `lib/migration/providers/session.ts` | Dedicated read-only PostgreSQL session (`default_transaction_read_only`, statement allowlist, write probe) and stable instance namespace/runtime fingerprint. |
| `lib/migration/providers/native.ts`, `providers/supabase.ts` | Provider consistency guards, instance inspection, Supabase Auth admin read port and Auth↔database read-only consistency proof. |
| `lib/migration/cli.ts`, `scripts/migrate-backend.ts` | `validate`, `inspect`, `preflight` commands; unambiguous exit codes 0/1/2/3/4/5. |
| `tests/migration-format.test.ts`, `tests/migration-cli.test.ts`, `tests/helpers/migration-fixtures.ts` | 53 unit tests over the contract, validator, CLI safety boundary and dry-run guarantees. |
| `tests/boundary-enforcement.test.ts` | Two new rules: application/package/mobile code cannot import migration tooling; migration tooling cannot import server-only sentinels, request-bound auth modules, `lib/db/pool`, Next.js modules or mail senders. |
| `package.json`, `.gitignore` | `npm run migration` (tsx); `/.migration-runs/` ignored. |

**Verification (executed):**

| Command | Result |
|---|---|
| `npx vitest run tests/migration-format.test.ts tests/migration-cli.test.ts` | 53/53 passed. |
| `npx vitest run tests/boundary-enforcement.test.ts` | 12/12 passed (including the two new migration rules). |
| `npm test` | 1386 passed, 56 pre-existing integration tests skipped (no `TEST_DATABASE_URL`/Supabase test env in this shell). |
| `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint` | Pass, no new warnings. |
| `npm run test:coverage` | Exit 0; aggregate thresholds intact; `lib/migration` at 82.31% lines / 73.44% branches / 85% functions. |
| Live `inspect --source native` against disposable `vsis_migration_native_test` (31 native migrations applied) | Read-only probe rejected a write; namespace `native:7071be336042327a…`; schema fingerprint computed; zero missing tables. |
| Live `inspect --target supabase` against the local Supabase stack | Read-only probe rejected a write; namespace `supabase:3167909b3f99f5e6…`; 65 applied migrations; Auth user list reachable. |
| Live `preflight` (fixture bundle, native source → Supabase target) | bundle/schema/migrations/distinct-instance checks pass; Auth binding reported `blocked` because the local project has no users yet → exit 5 (fail-closed as designed). |

**Decisions / deviations recorded:**

1. CLI command bodies live in `lib/migration/cli.ts`; `scripts/migrate-backend.ts` is a thin entry. The plan listed the script as the composition surface; keeping logic in a module makes the commands testable without spawning processes (same interface, no behavior change).
2. Connection env names must match `^MIGRATION_[A-Z0-9_]+$`. This is stricter than "explicitly named env var" and makes "never falls back to `DATABASE_URL`" mechanically enforceable and testable.
3. Added `lib/migration/schema.ts` and `lib/migration/providers/session.ts` as small shared modules beyond the plan's file list; the plan permits consolidating helpers.
4. Canonical kind for `titles.id` / `whitelisted_domains.id` is `uuid`; a `text`-primary-key target (native) therefore requires an explicit declared transformation in the manifest, matching the C00 provider-delta finding. Preflight fails closed without it.
5. JSONL must be canonical bytes and end with a newline; non-canonical rows and truncation are validation errors (`E_NON_CANONICAL_ROW`, `E_TRUNCATED`).
6. `preflight` exits `BLOCKED` (5) — not pass — when a Supabase target's Auth binding cannot be verified; the plan requires uncertainty to reject before import.
7. A temporary scratch script built the live-preflight fixture bundle; it was deleted after use and is not part of the tree.

## Remaining work / next eligible checkpoint

1. Operator inputs for the BLOCKED C00 items (volumes, budgets, backups, enrollment readiness, first direction).
2. C01 — bundle format, validator, explicit connectors and the operator CLI safety boundary (its database legs need a disposable environment).
3. C06A after C01M once the C00 operational inputs exist.
